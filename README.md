# MNISQ: A Large-Scale Quantum Circuit Dataset for Machine Learning on/for Quantum Computers in the NISQ era
this repository will be soon completed, we are refining the last details!

===> dataset is already accessible!


==> we just made the dataset executable from qiskit! See [doc/source/notebooks/qiskit_quickstart.ipynb](doc/source/notebooks/qiskit_quickstart.ipynb)



There is already the dataset and qml experiments, some guide can be found in doc/sources


This library provides machine learning datasets as a Qulacs's QuantumCircuit instance.

## How To Install

### pypi
```
pip install mnisq
```

### source install
```
pip install git+https://github.com/FujiiLabCollaboration/MNISQ-quantum-circuit-dataset.git
```

## Directory structure
- `doc/source/notebooks` provides sample usage of this library.
- `mnisq` and `tests` contains python code.
- `generator_scripts` contains scripts used to generate datasets.
